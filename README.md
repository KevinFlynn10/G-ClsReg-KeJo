# Goals
Create an input using some kind of hardware tool
Learn to create a project that incorporates regression and classification
# Tools
We used an xbox controller as our hardware input and processing to write our code. For output we used _________
# ML Choices

# Accomplished
During out project, we were successfully able to incorporate using an xbox controller as an input to control an output. We were able to take the inputs of the control and map them to a keyboard, then send the keyboard ASCII values as input to wekinator to control our output. Not only did this control a small drawing program, but it also controlled ____________
# Challenges
Some of the challenges that we faced during this project was getting our xbox controller to communicate with our input. We were unable to find a way to send the xbox inputs straight to wekinator, so we were able to find a work around by using software that allowed us to map the xbox controller to a keyboard. After that we were able to send keyboard inputs to wekinator and solved our problem that way. As for problems with our output __________

# What We Learned
From this project, we learned how to successfully combine regression and classification into one project. Not only that, but we were successfully able to implement some kind of hardware and write our own program that controlled this. Before this I personally have only used example inputs and outputs from Kadenze, but this project allowed us to be more creative and create something fun.
